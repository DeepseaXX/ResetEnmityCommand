# ResetEnmityCommand
[akira0245](https://github.com/akira0245/)'s [`Reset-dummy-enmity-command`](https://github.com/akira0245/Reset-dummy-enmity-command), updated for API7.

## Known Issues
Currently, only the single target command (`/resetenmity`) is working. <br>
I'll look into making `/resetenmityall` functional again when I have some free time.
